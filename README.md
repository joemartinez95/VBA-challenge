# VBA-challenge
For this assignment, we developed a VBA code with the purpose of identifying individual stocks and calculating the change in price from close at the end of the year to
open at the beginning of the year. 
For formatting, guidance on the proper code to apply was followed from the following source: https://www.statology.org/vba-percentage-format/.
Additionally, for the final step of populating final tickers that had largest % increase and decrease, guidance on how to do this through an xlookup was followed from this source: https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/xlookup/.
